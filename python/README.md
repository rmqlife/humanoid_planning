# Aurora Python Client

This is the Python client for the Aurora API. It allows you to interact with the Aurora API to retrieve data and perform actions on the Aurora platform.

## Using the Client

Start another terminal and use `docker exec` to enter the Aurora docker container you just started. Then, run the following command under `src` directory:

```
python3 -m examples.client_usage
```
Then you can follow the instructions in the terminal to interact with the Aurora API.

## v1.1.0 Release 

Prerequisites:

- GR-2 robot. (support for other fourier robots will be added in the future)
- Actuator version: 
    - Communication firmware version 0.3.12.31 or above.
    - Driver firmware version 0.2.10.30 or above.
    - NOTE: Actuator version can be upgraded using **FSA Assistant**. Click [FSA Assistant for Linux](https://fsa-1302548221.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/tool/FSA_Assistant/FSA_Assistant_V0.0.1.24_155_31_x64_Linux_2025-07-08.tar.gz) to download the latest version.
    - 
- Submodule: 
    - Aurora base environment.
    - **fourier_dds** version 1.1.0 or above. 
    - **fourier_hardware** version 1.1.2 or above.
    - NOTE: aurora base environment is provided in the docker image. **fourier_dds** and **fourier_hardware** can be installed and upgraded using deb packages.

## Installation

Please refer to [Installation Guide](./doc/EN/installation_EN.md) for installation instructions.

## Quick Start

Please follow the steps below to get started with controllers provided using joystick. If you are not familiar with the joystick, please refer to the [Joystick Tutorial](./doc/EN/joystick_tutorial_EN.md) for more information.

### Starting Container

You can start the container by running the following command in your terminal under the **root directory** of the repository:

```bash
bash docker_run.bash
```

NOTE: Please make sure that you have installed fourier-aurora and relative modules in the docker image as described in the [Installation Guide](./doc/EN/installation_EN.md).

### Preparation before Running Aurora

Aurora can control the robot in simulation or on the real robot. Before running Aurora, you need to follow the steps below:

#### Simulation

For simulation usage, you need to start another terminal and enter the container you just started using the following command:

```bash
(sudo) docker exec -it fourier_aurora_sdk bash
```

Then, you need to start the simulation environment by running the following command:

```bash
python3 sim/start_simulate_root.py
```

Follow the instructions and it will start the simulation environment. The robot will be placed in the starting position.

#### Real Robot

To control the real robot, please make sure that the following prerequisites are met:

- Actuator versions are compatible.
- Actuators are in Power-on state(purple light flashing slowly).
- Network communication is well established(all actuators ip pingable).
- Robot is in a neutral hanging state.

### Starting Aurora

After the preparation, adjust the configuration file `config/config.yaml` in this repository according to your needs. Please make sure `RunType` field is set correctly for simulation or real robot usage.

To start Aurora, simply run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
AuroraCore --config config/config.yaml
```
The following message will appear in the terminal if the program is running successfully:

```bash
[info] FSM state run, enter "Default" mode by default
```

This message indicates that the self-check is passed(real robot) and the Aurora program is ready to run tasks.

### Using joystick to Control the Robot

Now you can use the joystick to control the robot. Please refer to the [Joystick Tutorial](./doc/EN/joystick_tutorial_EN.md) for joystick usage.

Descriptions of the states and controllers can be found in [Controller Reference](./doc/EN/robot_controller_reference_EN.md).
